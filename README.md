# Encryption

## RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding

This simple Library demonstrates my implementation of working with RSA encryption, specifically RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding.

Library has no screen, to see it works you might want to run tests in the project.

Instrumental tests show the correctness of encryption with decryption of that same phrase.

This project based on:
- Kotlin
- Java Cryptography
- Factory Method Pattern
- Instrumental Tests
